# MyFirstCompiler

This is a very simple compiler I am working on. Mostly for fun and educational purposes

## Overview

This compiler compiles a BASIC style language into C code, it is written in Python, and demonstrates the
workings of a compiler on a very basic level.
The source code is very easy to follow, and the options are quite limitted at the moment,
but I do plan on developing my own ideas into this project in the future.
